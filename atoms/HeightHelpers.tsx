/**
 * The FlexibleHeight component is designed to manage layouts where a
 * component's height may dynamically change, such as expanding on hover.
 *
 * It effectively controls the space that the component and its children
 * can occupy in any given state. The 'h' prop specifies the base height,
 * which should be set to the initial height of the component plus any
 * additional space it may occupy when expanded.
 *
 * This ensures that the component has enough room to grow without
 * affecting the positioning of surrounding elements.
 *
 * The component is wrapped in a Position container with a relative
 * position, allowing the child component to be absolutely positioned
 * within it.
 *
 * This approach keeps the child component in a consistent location,
 * even as it changes size, preventing it from displacing other elements
 * in the layout.
